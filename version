<1.3.1>
- Let defaulted loans be repaid and automatically thaw the borrower’s accounts once the balance reaches zero.
- Reset is_defaulted alongside the status so cleared loans look like normal paid loans in the DB.
- Fix GetAccountCount to coerce the SQL result into a number, resolving the “Unable to create account” error on fresh installs.
